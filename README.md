# Medical-Insurance-Risk-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a simple yet reliable indicator that allows insurance providers to quickly assess whether a new applicant requires deeper evaluation before being granted a medical insurance policy. 

By analyzing demographic, lifestyle, clinical, and insurance-related information, we aim to predict whether an individual falls into a **low**, **medium**, or **high** medical risk category. This risk indicator serves as an early screening tool, helping insurers identify potentially costly applicants and prioritize detailed medical review only when necessary. 

Through exploratory analysis and machine learning modeling, we build a data-driven approach to support more efficient and informed decision-making in the insurance underwriting process.
